# Portchain Coding Challange (Terminal version)

## Introduction

This is the *Portchain Coding Challenge*! I was required to develop a simple project to fetch data from an external API, evaluate some statistics, and render the results.

### Execution

I developed a TypeScript application that fetches the data and renders the results in the terminal in a tabular manner.

## Getting Started

To run this application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm if you haven't already.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the project dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

## Execute the application:

    npm run start

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

    npm run test
